\maketitle

\newwatermark[allpages=true,scale=5,textmark=Draft\\Draft\\Draft\\Draft,color=gray!15,]{},

\hrule

This is a draft of items/elements that will be included in rubrics for
assignments and hacks.

\section*{General Guidelines}

\subsection*{Style}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Appropriate variable and function/method identifiers
  \item Style and naming conventions are consistent
  \item Good use of whitespace; proper indentation
  \item Clean, readable code
  \item Code is well-organized
\end{itemize}

Java style guide (eclipse default, google style guide)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Classes should be \mintinline{java}{UpperCamelCased}
  \item Variables should be \mintinline{java}{lowerCamelCased} and descriptive
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Well written comments that clearly explain the purpose of each non-trivial piece of code
  \item Comments explain the ``what'' and ``why''
  \item Comments are not overly verbose or overly terse
  \item Code itself is ``self-documenting''; it explains the ``how''
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Every class should be documented
  \item Every non-trivial method should be documented
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Program Design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code is well-organized and efficient
  \item Code is modular; substantial pieces of it could be reused; few redundancies
  \item Code is easily understood and maintainable
  \item It is clear that sufficient testing has been performed
  \item Corner cases and bad input have been anticipated and appropriate error handling has been implemented  
\end{itemize}

Dead code is *useless* code, not just "unused" code.  For example, when we went from phase 1 to phase 2 your serialization code was no longer directly used but it was NOT dead code.  Just because you use one math library function (say) does not make the other dozens of methods "dead code".  

Examples that are dead code:

You've written a chunk of code but it didn't work so you rewrote it, commenting out, but leaving the original
You've written code that is never reachable (an else block on an if statement that is never false)
You (re)wrote a class but kept the original (calling it, say InvoiceOld or something)
A private method that is never invoked in a class


\subsection*{Program Correctness}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Source code compiles and executes as expected
  \item Program runs as specified: correctly reads any input; correctly formatted output
  \item Test cases successfully execute
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section*{Hack Guidelines}

Each hack is worth 25 points distributed as follows.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline
Category & Points \\
\hline
Style & 2.5 \\
\hline
Documentation & 2.5 \\
\hline
Design & 5.0 \\
\hline
Correctness & 15.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Specific point deductions guidelines follow.  For each category, once all 
points are lost, no more points should be deducted for that category (the
minimum grade per category is zero).  However, all errors should be noted 
in the rubric comments.

\subsection*{Style}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proper use of whitespace including consistent spacing, indentation for all nested blocks, readability, etc.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Some (at least 2-3 instances or lines) of inconsistent whitespace style: -0.5
    \item Frequent misuse of inconsistent use of whitespace: -1 
    \item Extremely poor use of whitespace leading to unreadable code -2
  \end{itemize}
  \item Variable naming
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Inconsistent naming convention(s) of variables, functions, etc.: -1
    \item Non-descriptive, cryptic, or inappropriate variable naming: -1
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Missing ``header'' comment with author/date/etc. in all user-authored files
  \item Overly verbose or unnecessary comments, intermediate/development (i.e.\ \mintinline{text}{TODO}s) comments not removed from final version: -1
  \item Some function(s) lack proper documentation or include incorrect or inconsistent documentation style: -1
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Design}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compiler issues warnings that have not been taken care of -1 to -5 depending on severity
  \item Dead or extraneous code has not been removed, large sections of code are commented out but not deleted -1 to -5 depending on the severity
  \item Sufficiently reasonable error handling has been omitted regardless of how the webgrader runs -1 to -3 depending on severity
  \item User defined functions should not have bad behavior (such as ``debug'' or ``error'' print statements, exit conditions, etc.)
  \item Code contains redundancies such as extraneous variables, unused variables, copy-pasted/repeated code (instead of functions or loops as appropriate)
  \item Use of incorrect patterns, variable types, etc.
  \item Program contains obvious memory leaks or misuse of data types (static arrays when dynamic arrays are more appropriate) regardless of how the webgrader works
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Correctness}

Generally, points are awarded proportionally according to the number of test cases.
Points are lost for each test case such that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All tests must run completely without segfaults or other issues, program
  output should match expected output.
  \item The reported output (numbers) differ significantly from the expected output
  \item Formatting details need not match exactly, but must report \emph{at least} as much information as the expected output (but \emph{may} give more or may give alternative formatting).
  \item Output must be well-formatted and readable.
  \item Proportional credit given in the case of automated test suites
  \item If no substantial code is present but (some) test cases pass, credit should still not be awarded.
\end{itemize}
