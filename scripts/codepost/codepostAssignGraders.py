# this script interfaces with codepost and brings everything
# together:
# 1. It pulls the current roster from Canvas (and separates
#    instructors/graders/students using the config.py params)
# 2. It attempts to map NUIDs to CSE logins to grab submissions
#    (failures will be excluded or "orphaned")
# 3. It then randomizes grading assignments (tries to evenly
#    distribute among the graders) and produces a hardcopy report
# 4. It then scans the handin directory for specific files and
#    submits them to codepost.io with the assigning the grader to
#    each.
#
# This script assumes that the course and assignments have 
# already been setup and that no submissions have been made.
# Preexisting submissions will result in a fatal error (so it
# is best to do this cleanly and/or wipe the assignment on
# codepost.io and restart)
